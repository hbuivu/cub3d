-As long as the player is surrounded by walls, it is a valid map
-Spaces are considered movable spaces
-map content cannot be separated by a new line -> but if there are spaces in the extra line, it should still continue to be evaluated
-extra new lines after the map are not valid
-extra new lines with spaces after the map are valid
